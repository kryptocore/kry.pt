/*  
    Simple CSS CRT filter by 𝕂𝕣𝕪𝕡𝕥𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕦𝕥 (et al). My eclectic site -> https://kry.pt 
    Inspired by this filter by Alec Lownes: http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html . 
    Hopefully less RAM-hogging for those (like me) who hear their laptop fans spin up every 
    time they open their sites on Chrome or Edge.

    Made with love for the Neocities community <3

/*
    Instead of pure CSS like Alec's, I used a small APNG of a collection of pixels 
    for the "screen door" effect. Results in happy RAM but requires, yaknow, the image.
    This sometimes results in the filter loading slowly but is nice for pixel perfect scaling.
    If your browser doesn't support APNG, it will use the first frame as a fallback!

    Decided to leave this in as a usable class,
